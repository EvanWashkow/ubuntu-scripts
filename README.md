# Ubuntu Scripts

Installation scripts for Ubuntu Linux

**Please be sure to install any updates before running these scripts.**

## Branches

Some Ubuntu derivatives, such as Linux Mint and Elementary OS, have their own special code names that differ from their Ubuntu parent. These special code names break some 3rd-party PPAs, which these scripts rely on. Thus, you will need to switch to the branch that corresponds with the parent Ubuntu version in order to get these scripts to work.
